# A*Mazer - Maze Game

**A*Mazer** is a fun and challenging maze game built using **Raylib** in **C++**. The goal of the game is to navigate through a maze and reach the designated goal while keeping track of your time. Once you complete the maze, you can save your score to a leaderboard and challenge yourself to improve your speed.
